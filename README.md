# Banana-Republic
Our project uses Java Swing to create three panels. The middle panel has a big button with a banana; every time you click the button, you get a banana. It also displays a banana counter, bananas per second from your minions, a random quote, and your total clicks and clicks per second. A right Panel shows a shop of minions/farms that you can click on to produce the bananas. And a left panel that shows all the minions/farms youâ€™ve bought. It is essentially a clicker game modeled into a complex game with the features mentioned above.
